Move a ticket out of its container's c/, and reopen every closed ancestor
between it and the surface. One mv per level.

Reopening does not cascade downward — a reopened parent keeps its finished
children in its c/ — and does not reopen tickets that need it, since
dependencies constrain when work may start, not whether completed work
stays completed.
