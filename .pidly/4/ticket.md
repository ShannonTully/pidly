title: Closing moves a ticket into its parent's c/
desc:11
Closing is a move, at every depth: a child goes into its parent's c/, a
root goes into .pidly/c/. There is no marker file and no status field, so
location is the only thing that answers whether a ticket is done.

Done when close performs the move, reopening is specified as the same move
in reverse, and check confirms nothing inside a c/ tree has open children
sitting outside a c/.
